    "text": "Summary Statement\nAs a computational scientist, I am passionate about driving scientific discovery and innovation through creative, robust, and comprehensive computational analyses and approaches. I have accrued over 7+ years of research experience in statistical genetics and genomics, metagenomics, cancer genomics, clinical data analysis, and the interplay between genetics and environmental exposures. I have expertise in leading and executing research projects that integrate and interrogate molecular, exposure, and clinical data using methodologies from the fields of statistical genetics, microbial ecology, biostatistics, epidemiology, and machine learning. Large, multi-faceted data is key to deriving accurate insights into the complex questions we have about human and animal health, the ecosystem within and around us, and biology in general. My favorite projects are always those that tackle a question from multiple angles using both hypothesis-driven and hypothesis-free methodologies to uncover evidence-based insights.\n\n\nSkills\n\n\n    \n    \n    Skills\n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            Data Analysis / Statistics\n            \n                R (programming)\n                R and Quarto markdown\n                Python\n                GWAS\n                PheWAS\n                Statistical genetics\n                Microbial ecology\n                Epidemiology\n                Biostatistics\n                Cross-sectional data\n                Longitudinal data\n                Generalized linear models\n                Linear mixed models\n                Non-parametric methods\n                Network analysis\n                PCA\n                Mediation analysis\n                Machine learning\n                Data visualization\n                Clinical data analysis\n            \n        \n        \n            Bioinformatics / Computing\n            \n                HPC\n                Pipeline development\n                Metagenomic profiling\n                NGS quality control\n                Sequence alignment\n                Functional annotation\n                Big data\n                Shell scripting\n                Bash\n                Parallel computing\n                Linux\n                Git\n                GitHub\n                Visual Studio Code\n                Variant calling\n                Variant quality control\n                Software management\n                Data transport/storage\n            \n        \n        \n            Data Management\n            \n                Data extraction\n                SQL\n                Quality control\n                Data cleaning\n                Harmonization\n                Database design\n                Database management\n                Database query\n                Public databases/datasets\n                Security\n                Electronic medical records\n                Microsoft Excel\n            \n        \n        \n            Project Leadership and Management\n            \n                Study design\n                Protocol design\n                Human subject research\n                Animal model research\n                Project leading\n                Project management\n                Documentation writing\n                Collaboration\n                Organizational skills\n                Communication skills\n                Time management\n                Conflict management\n            \n        \n        \n            Interpersonal Skills\n            \n                Attentiveness\n                Empathy\n                Supportive\n                Adaptability\n                Teamwork\n                Leadership\n                Responsibility\n                Dependability\n                Patience\n            \n        \n        \n            Science Communication\n            \n                Scientific writing\n                Technical reporting\n                Presentation skills\n                Networking\n                Public speaking\n                Scientific editing\n                Social media",
